            <div main-heading><h4>Exploring the Science of Sorting Through Animation</h4> <div class="paragraph">Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, non-decreasing (increasing or flat), decreasing, non-increasing (decreasing or flat), lexicographical, etc).
             <br><br>
                There are many different sorting algorithms, each has its own advantages and limitations.
                <br>
                Sorting is commonly used as the introductory problem in various Computer Science classes to showcase a range of algorithmic ideas</div>
